        <h1> Problem Statement </h1>
        <p> <span> 1. Population Density: </span> The number of vehicles is constanfly on the rise, while the availability of parking space in cities has not kept pace with the increasing vehicle numbers, primarily due to the rapid growth in population. </p>
        <p> <span> 2. Illegal Parking: </span> Issues such as traffic congestion, narrowed streets due to on-street parking, a mismatch between parking supply and demand, and illegal parking have become all too familiar in lndian cities. </p>
        <p> <span> 3. Commercial Areas: </span> Business districts and commercial areas face acute parking shortages. Lack of designated parking for shoppers and employees often results in vehicles occupying spaces meant for other purposes. </p>
        <p> <span> 4. Parking Pricing: </span> In some areas, parking pricing is not reflective of market demand. Cheap or free parking in premium locations encourages more people to drive, exacerbating the parking shortage. </p>
        <p> <span> 5. Lack of Enforcement: </span> Inefficient enforcement of parking regulations and lack of penalties for illegal parking contribute to the persistence of the problem. </p>
        <p> <span> 6. Environmental Impact: </span> The increased number of vehicles, coupled with inefficient parking management, contributes to air and noise pollution and worsens the urban environment. </p>
